 *
 *      DIMContentType_Forward indicates here contains a TOP-SECRET message
 *      which needs your help to redirect it to the true receiver.
 *

 *      0000 0001 - this message contains plaintext you can read.
 *      0000 0010 - this is a message you can see.
 *      0000 0100 - this is a message you can hear.
 *      0000 1000 - this is a message for the robot, not for human.

 *      0010 0000 - this message contains the 3rd party content.
 *      0100 0000 - (RESERVED)
 *      1000 0000 - this is a message send by the system, not human.
 *
 *      (All above are just some advices to help choosing numbers :P)
